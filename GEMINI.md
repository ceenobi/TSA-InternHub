# React Router 7 Project Guidelines

## Core Conventions
- We use Framework Mode exclusively (do not use legacy `<BrowserRouter>` tags).
- All routes must define and export type-safe `Route.LoaderArgs` and `Route.ActionArgs`.
- Rely on `context.get()` inside loaders and middleware rather than legacy global context structures.
- Use the standard `+route.tsx` conventions for naming layouts and route endpoints.


# Project Overview: InternsPortal (Dashboard)

Interns portal is a modern, full-stack e-task grading platform designed for performance, scalability, and developer experience. It utilizes **React Router 7** in framework mode (formerly Remix) to deliver a seamless server-side rendered (SSR) experience with robust data loading and mutation capabilities.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework:** [React Router 7](https://reactrouter.com/) (Framework Mode)
- **Programming Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Backend / Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- **Search:** [MongoDB Atlas Search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/) (Lucene-based)
- **Authentication:** [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with MongoDB Adapter
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management & Data Fetching:** [TanStack Query (React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- **Caching & Workflows:** [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/redis), [QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash), and [Upstash Workflow](https://upstash.com/workflow)
- **Form Handling:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) & [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- **Media Management:** [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)


### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server with HMR
yarn dev

# Run QStash local development CLI
yarn qstash
```

### Production
```bash
# Build the application for production
yarn build

# Start the production server
yarn start
```

### Type Checking
```bash
# Run React Router type generation and TypeScript compiler
yarn typecheck
```

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style
- **Functional Components:** Use functional components with hooks.
- **Type Safety:** Maintain strict TypeScript typing. Ensure all domain objects have corresponding interfaces in `app/types.d.ts`.
- **Server Actions:** Complex mutation logic should be abstracted into `app/.server/action/*.ts` and called from route `action` functions.
- **Styling:** Follow the existing Tailwind CSS 4 patterns. Use the `cn()` utility for conditional class merging.
- **Icons:** Use `@remixicon/react` for all iconography.

### Data Fetching
- Use **Loaders** for initial page data.
- Use **TanStack Query** for client-side data synchronization and optimistic updates where appropriate.
- Leverage the `fetchWithCache` utility in `.server/utils/cache.ts` to reduce database load.

### Animation
- Utilize the `useWaveAnimation` hook for entrance animations to maintain consistency across the dashboard.

### Validation
- Always use **Zod** schemas (defined in `app/lib/formSchema.ts`) for both form validation and API payload verification.
- **Mongoose Mocks:** In Vitest mocks, ensure `findById`, `findOne`, etc., are mocked as chainable with `.lean()` if the production code uses it.

### Icons
- **Remixicon (`@remixicon/react`)** components do NOT accept a `title` prop — `RemixiconProps` does not include it. For accessible tooltips on icons, wrap the icon in a `<span title="...">` or use the project's `Tooltip` component instead.
